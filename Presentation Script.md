# Presentation

## Outline

* NoodleTools introduction -> Noted introduction
* Past experience (clock, Fanzter)
* What I don't have experience with
* Why replace NoodleTools? Why is it terrible?
* Research (why, how)
* Feature development (list, wireframing)
* The coding process (TDD to spaghetti code to non-TDD)
* Out of time, adopt Dieter Rams-like ethos
* Algorithmic process (Scholar)
* Evolution of the user interface (talk about Procko)
* Flat design (how better than skeumorphism)
* Resources used (GitHub, Stack Overflow, Fanzter)
* How I would do things differently next time around
* Current status and beta test announcement


## NoodleTools & Noted Introduction

* General consensus is that NoodleTools sucks.
* I made Noted to address that hatred.
* Noted is a research management tool

## Introduction, Experience

* Started in 6th grade ("Hello, world" experience)
* Clock was first real application (fairly simplistic)
* Fanzter far more complex (all the work already done)


## What I could learn from this experience

* Speed, safety, security, stability
* Maintaining a website for a lot of users solo


## Research

* "It sucks" isn't good enough
* Never done research for a website before
* Market research vs. consumer wants?
* Interviewed teachers and students
* Created a "dream list of features"
* Narrow down list to what is feasible in 9 months
* Avoiding the feature creep


## Why NoodleTools sucks

* Unintuitive (hard to do simple tasks)
* Students need help from teachers on doing things
* Tedious, time-consuming


## The Coding Process

* Started with test-driven development (write the code to test the functionality first, then write the code to actually do the feature)
* Wanted to do whole thing with TDD, but slow as balls
* It was cleaner and more efficient, but slow
* Abandoned TDD, went with just code, test later
* I worked faster, but code became shit
* Spaghetti code (code is messy, everything is reliant on each other, confusing)
* Was working faster, but starting to have trouble understanding my own code (sacrificing understanding what I'm doing for speed)
* Looking back on old code, no idea what it does
* Don't do this again!
