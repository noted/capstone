# Abstract

For custom capstone, I chose the innovation pathway and decided to create a web service. I looked at the problems that students have that could be solved by a web application and I created Noted, a service that helps organize and collaborate on research projects. Initially, I had lofty goals for what Noted could be, but as time went on and I fell further and further behind, I started stripping away extraneous features and created a site that is simpler and better at what it _does_ do.

I have quite a bit of previous experience with web design and development. Over the past two summers, I was a technology intern at Fanzter, a Unionville-based web startup that has multiple products that are used by thousands of people. I also created the Farmington High School Clock, replacing a nearly ten-year-old system that displays the day's schedule, current information, and time.

The idea for Noted came from frustration with current solutions to the problem of research management. A product that we use at school called NoodleTools was sufficient, but it was not intuitive to use. By creating a product that does similar features, I am trying to take the stress associated with creating citations and writing notes away.

Before capstone, I had not created a web application of this scale by myself. There are a lot of moving parts, and they all need to work seamlessly together or the whole site falls apart.
